# Hi

You might be wondering why im creating a decision tree and
appending each node's value to an array into a string which
returns an exec command for `go` and `npm`

I really dont know, i just thought it might be fun to make this one since i've never built one like this ever so... yeah, you could just opt out from this and use a regular command string to pass in to the `exec` function when using the build command on zensearch cli haha...
