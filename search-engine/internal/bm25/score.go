// BM25 combines term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document length normalization to provide a balanced relevance score.
//
//     TF reflects how often the term appears in the document.
//     IDF reflects how important the term is based on its rarity.
//     Document length normalization adjusts for the termâ€™s density and prevents long documents from dominating simply because of their length.
//
// Practical Impact on Ranking:
//
//     High TF and High IDF: If a rare term appears frequently in a document, that document is considered highly relevant.
//     High TF but Low IDF: A term that appears often but is common across documents will result in a lower score.
//     High IDF but Low TF: A rare term that appears only a few times can still result in a good score, especially in shorter documents.
//     Low TF and Low IDF: A common term that appears infrequently results in a low score.
